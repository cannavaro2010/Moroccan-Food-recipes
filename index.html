        <h3 class="itroduce">Moroccan chicken thighs recipe FAQ</h3>

        <p class="itroduce">Moroccan chicken tagine is a labor of love that can take a few attempts to get exactly the way you like it. To help you to slow cook the most morish and delectable of Moroccan chicken thighs, here's a quick FAQ to answer any questions you might have about preparing the recipe!
        <h3>How do I know my chicken is cooked?</h3>
        
        <p>When you're cooking Moroccan chicken thighs (and this is the same for all chicken dishes too, of course), it's always really important that you're certain that the chicken is cooked all the way through.
        
        Before simmering the tagine, you'll have already browned the chicken thigh pieces, but you still need to be careful that the chicken is actually cooked right through to its center. If you notice any pink bits, then leave the chicken to simmer for longer. If you poke the chicken pieces with a fork, then the fork should come out of the chicken hot.
        
        The beauty of a tagine, is that the longer you simmer the ingredients, the tastier it's going to be, so don't worry about overcooking (the longer, the better!).
        </p>
        <h3> Can I prepare Moroccan chicken thighs ahead of time?</h3>
        
        <p>Yes, this is the perfect recipe to prepare well ahead of time. Prepare your tagine ingredients in the morning or even the night before. You can simmer everything, and then let it cool down, before leaving it covered on the side, or leaving overnight in the fridge.
        
        When you're ready for dinner, you can heat the tagine up and finish it off on the stovetop while you prepare your fresh couscous. If you're doing this, try to save the cilantro and other fresh herbs until you actually serve the dish, that way you can give it that tasty fresh boost!
      </p>
        <h3>Can I marinate the chicken thighs?</h3>
  
        
        <p>Truly authentic tagine takes a long time to prepare and to cook. If you have the time, you can give your chicken thighs a tasty kick by allowing them to marinate overnight in the fridge.
        
        You can prepare your spices in advance, and mix them all together in a large bowl, before then rubbing the spices into the chicken thighs. Allow them to simply sit in the fridge until you're ready to cook with them the next day, and they should be much, much tastier!
      </p>
        <h3>How long can I store tagine in the fridge?</h3>
        
        <p>If you've made too much tagine, then you can keep it in the fridge and reheat it again later. To keep in the flavor, we wouldn't recommend leaving it for more than 48 hours before you eat it. Store it in a resealable bag or container, or simply keep it in the tagine pot you cooked it in!
        
        When you're ready to reheat, you're best letting it slowly simmer on the stovetop, so it heats all the way through. If you're in a hurry, then you can blast it quickly in the microwave, but we don't recommend this if you want to keep in the taste.
      </p>
        <h3>Can I freeze tagine?</h3>
        
        <p> We'll be honest with you here; tagine isn't the best meal to freeze. You can do it, but it can make the tagine super watery when you thaw it, and you're bound to lose many of the fresher spices and tastes.
        
          If you do freeze the tagine, then make sure you freeze it in a suitable container or a ziplock bag. it's time to eat again, try to let it thaw naturally on the side, overnight if you have to. To reduce the liquid, allow the tagine to reheat by simmering it slowly on the stovetop in a saucepan or in the tagine pot.
            Cook once, and eat twice: it’s a simple idea and, once you get the hang of it, could become a habit. Doubling a recipe is economical and freezing half of the dish prevents unnecessary waste (and gluttony!). Keep a freezer drawer for frozen dinners and you’ll soon be able to halve your cooking time.

            What to Freeze </p><details><summary>Cilck here to continue reading...</summary><p>
            Some vegetables and other products have a short frozen life or don’t thaw well – but the recipes below are suitable for freezing. In general, stews, sauces and soups will freeze well. Try:
            Carrot and Coriander Soup: Soften one onion in 1tbsp butter, then add about 400g (4-5) medium carrots, ½ tsp cardamom seed, and 1 clove garlic. Cook gently for a minute. Tip in 300ml vegetable stock and 200ml coconut milk, bring to a simmer, and cook until the carrots are tender. Spoon into a blender with ½ bunch (35g) coriander, and whiz the soup until smooth. Cool before freezing
            
            It’s perfectly okay to freeze cooked meat, but be careful with it. Once you’ve cooked your meat or sauce, divide it into portions and cool thoroughly (and quickly) in the fridge before labelling and freezing. Try:
            Beef Bolognese: Soften two onions, sliced, in 1tbsp olive oil. Stir in 200g chopped mushrooms and 100g diced bacon; cook until the bacon browns. Remove from the pan. In the same oil, brown 800g beef mince in batches, then put in all the browned beef with the mushrooms and bacon. Add 400ml (2 glasses) red wine with 1 tin chopped tomatoes and enough beef stock to cover. Add 2 bay leaves and 1tbsp fresh oregano. Simmer for 1 ½- 2 hours, topping up with stock as necessary. Cool and freeze.<summary></summary>
