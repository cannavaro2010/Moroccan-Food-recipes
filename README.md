# Moroccan-Food-recipes
My first milestone project,introducing Moroccan kitchen, recipes, and methods, using HTML and CSS.
address and contact numbers are just examples, so
the main page, providing a description and short video of the Moroccan kitchen,
and answers for some necessary questions.
The magic background photo added a small touch and atmosphere, like you were in a famous restaurant in Marrakesh.
The second page is the tasty side, where there is flavour, recipes, and delicious ready food images...
By the end, a short guide to making the traditional Moroccan tea will be provided.
on the last page of my website,a quick form to sign up and get notification of new recipes...
I used a map link for a real coffee place,as I was not able to provide my own.
All images came from external sources: Google Images, a Moroccan kitchen recipes website, and https://humandiaries.com/2015/09/23/moroccan-tagine/.
The introducing video on the main page came from a YouTube vlog link: https://www.youtube.com/cookingwithalia
screenshots of my first project ,are lsited on Moroccan Food Recipes file, with Readme,index.css ,index.html...
